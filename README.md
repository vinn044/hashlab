HashLab is a simple, educational Python tool built to demonstrate how common password hashing algorithms work and why weak passwords are vulnerable to dictionary attacks. The program takes a target hash, a selected hashing algorithm, and a user-provided wordlist file, then hashes each word in the list and compares it against the target value until a match is found. It’s intentionally straightforward and readable, focusing on learning rather than speed or optimization. HashLab is meant for understanding basic cybersecurity concepts like hashing, password storage, and attack fundamentals in a controlled, educational context.

Keep in mind this program will prompt you with a question asking what word list you would like to use to help you with the decryption of the hashes. I highly recommend using the famous yourock.txt file. I wanted to link it here myself but it's too big of a file, and there is plenty of repositories that have them.
