HashLab is a simple, educational Python tool built to demonstrate how common password hashing algorithms work and why weak passwords are vulnerable to dictionary attacks. The program takes a target hash, a selected hashing algorithm, and a user-provided wordlist file, then hashes each word in the list and compares it against the target value until a match is found. It’s intentionally straightforward and readable, focusing on learning rather than speed or optimization. HashLab is meant for understanding basic cybersecurity concepts like hashing, password storage, and attack fundamentals in a controlled, educational context.
